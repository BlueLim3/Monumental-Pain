/* PlayOver.js
 * 6/13/2017
 * This file contains the PlayOver state.
 * The PlayOver state is one of the two primary gameplay states,
 * in this state the player is on a top down view of the world which
 * doubles as a map. In this map the player can move around, enter towns
 * or encounter enemies, any situation which involves entering a place will
 * start the PlayPlatform state where are npcs, buildings, and battle occur
